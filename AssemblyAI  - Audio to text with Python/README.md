# How to use the py files in this folder
* Get AssemblyAI API key by creating a account at https://www.assemblyai.com.
* Save main.py and api_secrets.py in a folder, e.g., I named my folder as 'AssemblyAI' and saved it on my Desktop.
* Put your audio file in the folder, e.g., I put my audio file 'test.m4a' in my 'AssemblyAI' folder
* Open Command Prompt (press the Windows key + R; or open the start menu, type cmd, and click enter).
* In Command Prompt, navigate to your folder, e.g., for me I put this command: cd Desktop\AssemblyAI
* After navigating to your folder, run the main.py file in Command Prompt, e.g., for me I put this command: python main.py test.m4a
* When the audio text is ready, you will see a txt file in your folder.
